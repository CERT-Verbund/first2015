BYOB Event / Soccer
-------------------

Bring your own Bottle event combined with Soccer / Football

SpVgg Tiergarten 58 e.V. ,10553 Berlin

Dates: 

Event starts at 1900

Soccer starts at 1930

BBQ starts at approx. 2030

We will have referees.

The football club is about 4.1 km away from the Hotel Interconti. It
is a 10 minutes drive by taxi or an approx. 30 min. ride with public
transportation plus a short walk. It is nicely located at a river
bend of the Spree.

There are changing rooms with showers for the players and we can use
a half sized football field until 22:00, and even have floodlight if
necessary. Artificial turf - plastic grass, no cleats please!!!
And we have the clubhouse where we can sit inside and outside for the
BYB Session.

Furthermore, we have organised a light barbecue with sausages, pork
steaks, minced meat beef steaks (burgers), various salads, bread and
dessert. For the food and some sparkling water, we kindly ask
attendees to pay a small amount of 15 Euro.

Additionally, some Bavarian colleagues sponsor 150 l of their
self brewed crafted beer for free that they bring to Berlin. For the
connoisseurs,

it is Kellerbier or Zwickelbier. Our thanks go to Robert Schenk (BMW
CERT) and Thomas Schreck (Siemens CERT) for brewing the bIeR and
Christoph Fischer (BFK) for organising the transport to Berlin.
